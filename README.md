Music Genre Classification
Overview

A machine learning and deep learning project for classifying music into 10 genres using synthetic audio features (MFCCs). Multiple models are implemented and evaluated, with visualizations to analyze performance.

Genres: blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, rock

Features

Synthetic dataset generation with MFCC-like features

Sample spectrograms for different audio signals

Models implemented:

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

MLP (scikit-learn)

MLP (Keras / TensorFlow)

Class distribution visualization

Feature importance and correlation analysis
